# Low Quality Images
### How did I make the low quality images?
I'm using 4:3 aspect ratio so the dimensions are ```320x240, 114x152, 152x203,``` 

Another aspect ratio is 
* 3:2, 102x152, 203x305, 254x381
* 5:4: 203x254,
* 6:5: 254x305

Idk man you should just standardize it once you find a good size like ```300x250``` or something
### Dither!
  In ```GIMP: Colors > Dither```

  ```Dithering Method: Bayer``` (Used in older compressed images)
  ```Bit depth: RGB 565?``` That seems to be good
