     <p>The Canadian Engineering Competition 2024 was hosted by the University of Calgary!
        We were able to fly out of Winnipeg to join a competition with the best of the best
        against engineering schools all across Canada.
        Each of the 4 regions (Western, Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic) were able to bring two
        teams for each category. In total for each category 8 teams will be competing against each other.

     <p>The prompt for this competition was nothing like we've done before, but we came with our game faces on.
        The Schulich School of Engineering was a great place to work. The room we worked in was very easy to focus and colaborate in.
     </p>
     <p>After 8 hours of gruling work, we had our program and presentation ready for the next day.
        All we could do now was relax and enjoy our evening in Calgary, Alberta.
     </p>
     <p>On Sunday March 3, we presented our application to the panel of judges, and heard the 
        final results that evening. Out of eight teams from all across the entirety Canada, we came in 
        <b>FIRST</b> place!

  <h1>Western Engineering Competition (W.E.C.)</h1>

  <p>Following our university's engineering competition, our team (Pictured, 
  from left to right: Gary, Connor, Abraham, Daigh) found out we 
  qualified for the Western Engineering Competition 2024! This competition 
  gathers students from western Canada's engineering universities and pits them 
  against each other in competitions divided by categories. (Junior Design, 
  Senior Design, Innovative Design, Impromptu Debate, Consulting Engineering, 
  Communications, Re-Engineering, and <b>Programming</b>)</p>

  <p>Our team was competing in the programming competition. Our prompt was 
  to create an application that will help the congnitively disabled to gain 
  their own independence using our app. We only had 8 hours to come up 
  with a project plan, our presentation, and to execute it. The first bit 
  was all brainstorming as we shared our thoughts and ideas, along with how 
  we might be able to implement them. By the end of the first hour, 
  we've come up with a full game plan.</p>
  <p>The next few hours flew by quick as we were all on our laptops busy programming, 
  reading documentation, and new ideas on the fly. Gary and I worked on the front end
  while Abraham and Daigh worked on the backend. Later into our 8 hours we had to 
  begin creating our presentation.</p>
  <p>We presented our application to the panel of judges the next day, and heard the 
  final results that evening. Out of nine teams from all across western Canada, we came in 
  second place! Second and first place at WEC qualifies to continue to the 
  <b>Canadian Engineereing Competition (CEC) 2024</b> in Calgary! The next competition 
  takes place from March 1-5th and I'm most looking forward to competing with my team again.</p>
